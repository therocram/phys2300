PHYS 2300 Final Project Documentation
Used to Document research and changes to Project
Updated 11/15/2021

11/15/2021:
-Project Documentation created
-Topic Updated: Solving EM problems with numerical methods:
	-Finite Difference
	-Monte-Carlo
	-Method of Lines?
-Updated Reading List:
	Essential:
	-Boundary Value Problems and Partial Differencial Equations (Powers): Chapter 7
	-Numerical Techniques in Electromagnetics (Sadiku): Chapters 1, 2, 3, 8, 9(?)
	-Speak with Dr. Cornell
	As necessary:
	-Introduction to Electrodynamics (Griffiths): Electromagnetic Waves, Electrodynamics
	-Computer Simulation Methods (Gould, Tobochnik, Christian): Chapter 10: Electrodynamics
-Ideas for Error Reduction:
	-Decreasing Step Size and Observing how much values changes
	-Observing conserved quantities
	-Compare to analytical solutions
	
11/23/2021:
-Project has since changed in scope:
	-Focus is on solving for electrostatic potential in a 3D region with the relaxation
	 method
-Have program and analysis done by Monday: 11/29
-Forms of Error Found:
	-Changing the initial populated guess affects solution values further from boundary conditions
	-relaxFactor values between 1.5-1.7 speed up the program significantly (1/3 as many steps)
	-Increasing the mesh resolution significantly changes the values obtained but is usually within tolerance.
	-Increasing the mesh resolution from 20 to 40 made a relaxFactor of 1.8 the fastest value.
-Graphics and Visualization Ideas:
	-Importing data to Mathematica to animate a series of contour plots; this seems better than working with 3D surfaces
	-Side by side comparison of analytical and numerical data.
	
11/24/2021:
-Graphics and Visualization:
	-Program has been moved to a Jupyter Notebook environment and renamed "RelaxationTestJ.py"
	-The Jupyter Notebook environment executes the algorithm much slower (it takes about 4 times as long as a traditional
	 Python environment) but it is overall a much better environment because it allows the code to be seperated into "cells"
	 so that different parts of the program can be executed seperately. This allows me to run the relaxation algorithm once
	 and then experiment with graphing the data without having to re-run the algorithm multiple times.
