PHYS 2300 Final Project Documentation
Used to Document research and changes to Project
Updated 11/15/2021

11/15/2021:
-Project Documentation created
-Topic Updated: Solving EM problems with numerical methods:
	-Finite Difference
	-Monte-Carlo
	-Method of Lines?
-Updated Reading List:
	Essential:
	-Boundary Value Problems and Partial Differencial Equations (Powers): Chapter 7
	-Numerical Techniques in Electromagnetics (Sadiku): Chapters 1, 2, 3, 8, 9(?)
	-Speak with Dr. Cornell
	As necessary:
	-Introduction to Electrodynamics (Griffiths): Electromagnetic Waves, Electrodynamics
	-Computer Simulation Methods (Gould, Tobochnik, Christian): Chapter 10: Electrodynamics
-Ideas for Error Reduction:
	-Decreasing Step Size and Observing how much values changes
	-Observing conserved quantities
	-Compare to analytical solutions
	
11/23/2021:
-Project has since changed in scope:
	-Focus is on solving for electrostatic potential in a 3D region with the relaxation
	 method
-Have program and analysis done by Monday: 11/29
-Forms of Error Found:
	-Changing the initial populated guess affects solution values further from boundary conditions
	-relaxFactor values between 1.5-1.7 speed up the program significantly (1/3 as many steps)
	-Increasing the mesh resolution significantly changes the values obtained but is usually within tolerance.
	-Increasing the mesh resolution from 20 to 40 made a relaxFactor of 1.8 the fastest value.
-Graphics and Visualization Ideas:
	-Importing data to Mathematica to animate a series of contour plots; this seems better than working with 3D surfaces
	-Side by side comparison of analytical and numerical data.
